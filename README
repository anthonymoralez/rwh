While reading Real World Haskell (http://book.realworldhaskell.org), I am
typing out the code they provide and attempting some of the exercises.

All code here is directly from the book, except for code to solve 
exercises, and therefore copyright belongs to the authors:
Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen.

The exercises are my own code and are PUBLIC DOMAIN.
